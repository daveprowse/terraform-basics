## Introduction
Hello and Welcome!

This repository and corresponding live event are designed to teach the basics of Terraform and prepare you to use it in the field.

Within this repository you will find lab instructions that coincide with the live-stream webinar.

## Recommendations
To follow along with me I suggest you have the following ready:

- A Linux virtual machine (Recommended: Debian, Ubuntu Desktop, or Fedora workstation) with the following:

  - Minimum 1 CPU and 1 GB RAM (Recommended: 2 CPUs and 4 GB RAM)

  - Updated operating system:

    - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`

    - Fedora: `sudo dnf update -y`

  > Note: I suggest using VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, KVM or Proxmox for your virtual machines.

  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed.
  - Access to a terminal. In the webinar I use the Gnome Terminal.

- An AWS account with a separate IAM user for lab purposes (with **admin** permissions and AWS console access). You can create one here: https://aws.amazon.com/.

> Note: !!! Creating infrastructure on AWS or other cloud providers can incur a cost. Do not apply infrastructure if you do not want to be charged. 
> Amazon allows 750 hours of virtual machine usage (per month) on qualifying free tiers at AWS. Make sure that your region and AMI are part of the free tier program. For a pre-cost analysis see this link: https://calculator.aws

- Two or more monitors (or a second system) to display additional resources
